## Risks

DeFi protocols involve various risks:

- **Smart Contract Risk**: Despite audits, there may be undiscovered vulnerabilities.
- **Economic Risk**: The protocol design may have unforeseen economic consequences.
- **Regulatory Risk**: Changes in regulatory environment may impact the protocol.
- **Oracle Risk**: Incorrect price feeds may affect protocol operations.

## Tokenomics

[If applicable, include details about your protocol token]

- **Token Name**: XYZ
- **Total Supply**: X,XXX,XXX
- **Distribution**:
  - Team: XX%
  - Investors: XX%
  - Community: XX%
  - Treasury: XX%

## Governance

[If applicable, explain how protocol governance works]

The protocol is governed by XYZ token holders who can create and vote on proposals for protocol changes.
